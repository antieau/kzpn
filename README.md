# KZPN

`SAGE` code and examples for computing the p-adic syntomic cohomology and p-adic algebraic
K-groups of quotients of rings of integers in totally ramified p-adic fields.

This code has been verified to work in `SAGE 10.3`.

This version includes preliminary code for computing the action of v1 on the mod p syntomic
complexes. There is a working version which will be included in a future
update.



## Instructions

### Installation

Ensure that `SAGE` is
[installed](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html).
Clone this `git` repository by running the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:antieau/kzpn.git
```


### Using

There are three example files `example*.py` in the main directory to illustrate how to use the
code and there is a file `example.ipynb` which can be accessed and explored using `sage
--notebook`. The example files can be run, for example, by executing the following

```
sage example_2101_n2_i2.py
```

from the command-line.
