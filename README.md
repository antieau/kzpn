# Syntomic cohomology.
`SAGE` code and example worksheet for computing the p-adic syntomic cohomology and p-adic algebraic
K-groups of quotients of rings of integers in totally ramified p-adic fields.

This code has been verified to work in `SAGE 10.2`.

This version includes preliminary code for computing the action of v1 on the mod p syntomic
complexes, but it is not finished.
